Content layout shift happens when elements move around as images load, creating a jarring user experience. This is especially problematic on mobile devices where slow connections can cause significant delays in image loading.

## The Problem

When an image loads without predefined dimensions, the browser initially renders a collapsed element (0 height), then suddenly expands it when the image loads, pushing content down and disrupting the user's reading flow.

## The Solution: Reserve Space with Aspect Ratios

The key is to reserve the correct amount of space before the image loads using Tailwind's aspect ratio utilities.

### Basic Image with Layout Shift Prevention

```html
<!-- Bad: No space reserved, causes layout shift -->
<img
  src="https://picsum.photos/600/300"
  alt="Example image"
  class="w-full"
/>

<!-- Good: Space reserved with aspect ratio -->
<img
  src="https://picsum.photos/600/300"
  alt="Example image"
  class="w-full h-auto aspect-[600/300] object-cover"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### Complete Example with Figure Element

```html
<figure class="mx-auto max-w-2xl">
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/800/400"
    alt="Landscape photo"
    class="w-full h-auto aspect-[2/1] object-cover rounded-lg"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <figcaption class="mt-2 text-center text-sm text-gray-600">
    A beautiful landscape that loads without shifting content
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Responsive Images with Different Aspect Ratios

```html
<img
  src="https://picsum.photos/600/400"
  alt="Responsive image"
  class="w-full h-auto aspect-[3/2] md:aspect-[16/9] object-cover"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### Gallery Grid Without Layout Shifts

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/300?random=1"
    alt="Gallery image 1"
    class="w-full h-auto aspect-square object-cover rounded"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/300?random=2"
    alt="Gallery image 2"
    class="w-full h-auto aspect-square object-cover rounded"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/300?random=3"
    alt="Gallery image 3"
    class="w-full h-auto aspect-square object-cover rounded"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</div>
```

## Key Tailwind Classes Explained

- `w-full`: Makes image full width of container
- `h-auto`: Allows height to scale proportionally
- `aspect-[600/300]`: Sets aspect ratio (width/height)
- `object-cover`: Crops image to fit without stretching
- `object-contain`: Scales image to fit without cropping
- `loading="lazy"`: Defers loading until image is near viewport

## Common Aspect Ratios

```html
<!-- Square -->
<img class="aspect-square" />

<!-- Standard photo -->
<img class="aspect-[4/3]" />

<!-- Widescreen -->
<img class="aspect-[16/9]" />

<!-- Custom ratio -->
<img class="aspect-[600/300]" />
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Always specify aspect ratios** for images to prevent layout shift
2. **Use `loading="lazy"`** for images below the fold
3. **Use `object-cover`** when you want to fill the space
4. **Use `object-contain`** when you want to show the full image
5. **Test on slow connections** to verify no layout shifts occur

This approach ensures smooth loading experiences and better Core Web Vitals scores, particularly for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
