# About me

My name is Victor and I have been a web developer since 2018.

I have studied Biochemistry in university, but I never really appreciated learning all the different molecules, proteins, pathways and chemistry associated with the processes in the body.
Even though I found the topic very interesting, I realized that IT is more the place for me.

I did my [master thesis](https://github.com/ViggieM/MasterThesis) at the Max Plank Institute of Biochemistry where I was mostly preoccupied with [simulating data for electron microscopy](https://github.com/ViggieM/TEM-Simulator) (EM), in order to measure the effectiveness of the Volta phase plate for reconstruction of proteins.
There, I also got the opportunity to build [my first web application](https://github.com/ViggieM/MPIApp) in Flask, that was combining the output of several programs to automate the data collection and processing of EM data.
