Static files are JavaScript, CSS and every other files that are served by your web server and are not HTML.
During development, the `runserver` command takes care of serving them, as long as `staticfiles` is in your INSTALLED_APPS.
In the console we can see how the individual files are accessed.

But in Production we need to serve our static files differently, since our application is run by guinicorn and we can not use `runserver` for various performance and security reasons. [^1]

We have basically three viable options for a production django app:
1. Whitenoise behind a caching service like Cloudflare, Cludfront, 
2. Serve your static files through a web server like nginx
3. Serve your static files from a cloud storage, like AWS or GoogleCloudStorage

* install `whitenoise[brotli]` with poetry
* folder structure
* configure cloudflare

[^1]: Actually sometimes it's totally fine to use runserver if you only have a small application, low traffic and it is not publicly accessible.
