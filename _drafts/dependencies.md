From Django DX:

> On medium sized teams, upgrading everything every two weeks, or once a month,
> should be regular enough.
> On smaller teams, you may want to have a more relaxed frequency.
> On larger teams, you may in fact dedicate more resources to upgrading continu-
> ously. Indeed the largest tech companies often have a “everything builds from the
> latest version” policy.
