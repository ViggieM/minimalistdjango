People say SQLite is a database that is unsuitable for production use because of low performance, inability to handle
multiple concurrent writes, and many other reasons.
This might not be quite true.

I wanted to do this article a long time ago, but after visiting DjangoCon Europe 2023 and listening to this talk, 
I was convinced that I am not the only one who considers using SQLite in production.
I highly recommend watching the entire video, and this article summarizes what was mentioned in the talk.

## SQLite is already in production

If you are curious to see how many SQLite databases you already have on your laptop without even knowing about them, you can run:

```bash
find / \( -name "*.db" -o -name "*.sqlite" -o -name "*.sqlite3" \) -type f -exec file {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep SQLite
```



## Set up Django to run with SQLite

When creating a new Django project, it comes with following default setting for `DATABASES`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```

You don't need to use `dj-database-url` to configure your `DATABASES` setting, since the location of the file is flexible and not dependent on an absolute path.
