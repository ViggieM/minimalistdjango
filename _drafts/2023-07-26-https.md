# Transport layer security
http is not encrypted by default.
asymmetric encription is expensive
what ensures that the public key recieved from the server is the real one?

# certificate authorities
CAs sign the public key of a server with their own private key. 
The resulting certificate contains the public key of the server and a signature that can be verified with the CAs public key.
The CAs public key is also signed by another key, whose public key might also be signed by another key, and so on.
Ultimately the certificate chain ends at the root certificates, that are self signed.

# creating a certificate
You don't necessary need a certificate authority to sign your public key.
You can generate a public and private key pair on your own and sign the public key with the same private key.
This is called a self signed certificate.
Here is how you can do it:
... code ...
Then you can use the certificate and the key as settings in the gunicorn.conf.py file.
Now when you start gunicorn, your app will be automatically served with https.
The problem is that browser won't accept self signed sertificates as safe.
Therefore you have to use a CA that signs your certificate signing request.
