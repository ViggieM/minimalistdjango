## Provisioning

The provisioning step sets up the host and installs all required third party software that your application relies on.
In this step you might want to install typical software like *Git*, *Supervisor*, *Pyenv*, *Nginx*, *etc...*
You also want to set up a separate user for your app, separate from the one that you use to ssh on the node, to isolate the application from the rest of the system and not accidently allow it to perform actions with superuser privileges.
I like to give the user the same name as my app to avoid any confusion.

The steps to achieve this have already been described in previous posts, but here is the summary:
1. Update package lists
2. Create a user and a group that will be the owner of all application related files and folders
3. Install *git*, which is required to clone our repository from *GitHub*. We could also pull it locally, and copy it over to the host, but this takes generally longer.
4. Install *pyenv* as described [in this post]({% link _posts/2023-06-10-virtualbox.md %})

Now that you have set up your host, you can proceed to deploying your application to the remote host.

## Deployment

During deployment you make sure that your application's source code is transfered to the remote host and all third party software is configured in such a way that they are able to interact with each other and your application.

Now that you have described all the steps required to deploy your application, you can execute the playbook with ... and deploy your application

## Final notes

Your application is now running on <IP address> as you can see in your browser.
