# Tips & Tricks

1. **Highlight comments in red**

    I got this from the [Clean Code Lectures][clean-code]
    by Uncle Bob. I am not a particular fan of object-oriented programming, and I think this quote hits the nail on its head:

    > You can make classes, but you can only ever make one instance of them. This shouldn't affect how most object-oriented programmers work.
    >

    but this advice is gold.
    That's because it forces you to keep your comments small, or make them obsolete, by making the code self-explanatory, or in case
    a comment is appropriate, it highlights it as important.
