## What is this blog about?

This blog is about my journey to become a senior web developer.
What makes a senior developer?
When I think about my colleagues at Blueshoe and CHECK24, there are a few things that they have in common:

* deep knowledge of the technologies they are working with
* breadth of knowledge of web development in general
* frustration tolerance
* don't panic when things go wrong

Some things can be learned from a book, some things can only be learned by experience.
And the only way to learn, is by doing.
