## Who am I?

I want to learn what web development is all about.

I started as a web developer at [Blueshoe](https://www.blueshoe.de/){:target="_blank"} after my biochemistry master.
In three years I had the opportunity to work on 10+ small to medium-sized projects with colleagues who were really good at what they were doing.

After three years and a pandemy I realized that my job was taking too much of my attention, and I was not able to focus on my personal life and my hobbies. 
I decided to quit my job and go for a sabbatical to travel in south america and experience different cultures and ways of living.

After my return I started as a professional web developer at [CHECK24](https://www.check24.de/){:target="_blank"}.
In contrast to my previous job at a startup, there is not so much pressure to deliver fast, and I am able to focus more on learning and doing things "the right way".
Due to the size of the company, I am much more involved in politics that don't really contribute to my web development skills, but improve my communication skills tremendously.

Currently, I am still employed at CHECK24, and I am working towards a promotion to a senior position.

## What is this blog about?

This blog is about my journey to become a senior web developer.
What makes a senior developer?
When I think about my colleagues at Blueshoe and CHECK24, there are a few things that they have in common:

* deep knowledge of the technologies they are working with
* breadth of knowledge of web development in general
* frustration tolerance
* don't panic when things go wrong

Some things can be learned from a book, some things can only be learned by experience.
And the only way to learn, is by doing.
