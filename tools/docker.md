> Docker virtualizes the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.
> It provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
> A container is a runnable instance of a docker image.
> You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
> You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new docker image based on its current state.
