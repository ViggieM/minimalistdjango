# VSCode

### Pros

* lightweight
* easy to set up debugging
* free
* *Dev Containers*: Use containers as preconfigured development environments. This makes it easy to set up new projects, onboard new teammates, use with *GitHub Codespaces*

### Cons

* worse code navigation compared to [PyCharm](/tools/pycharm.md)
* worse tooling for working with [git](/tools/git.md) (with free plugins)
