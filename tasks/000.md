you are a planner that has all the instructions needed in this file @tasks/000.md and creates a better formulated and structured instructions list in a new file called tasks/001.md.
Here are the tasks that need to be acomplished:

- [ ] the header image has a padding on mobile. make the header image full width on mobile screens
- [ ] align h1 headings left and decrease the font size on mobile screens
- [ ] add og and meta attributes for every route. make sure to associate it with the data from the frontmatter. Use a default image based on the @media/django-rocket.svg in case the frontmatter does not specify any other image
- [ ] make following adaptations to the website visitor's search experience:
  - beneath the search bar, create three boxes reading 'TIL', 'Articles' and 'Snippets'. The background color of the box is the currently also defined colors for these types of posts. Each box has a checkbox and the text inside. The checkbox, when checked, has the color '--color-text', that is defined as CSS variable
  - initially, all boxes are checked, that means all posts are displayed. when one of the checkboxes is unchecked, the corresponding posts are hidden. consider hiding the posts with css. but evaluate also the solution for doing it programatically. please present me a plan for both implementations. i will pick one, depending on the code you write
  - consider for the code structure following nice to have features in the future:
    - when all checkboxes are unselected, then the image @media/refactoring.png is displayed
    - you are able to sort the search results either by date, or by score (relevance to the search term). a dropdown next to the boxes shall be used
    - don't write the code for it, but consider it in your thought process and structure the code to be able to extend it in the future
- [ ] it should be able to add a youtube video instead of the header image. The caption should be the youtube video's title. This should happen only client side (rendering the caption from the youtube video)
- [ ] create a sitemap.xml for better SEO for all the routes in @src/pages. Also, consider this article on the web for suggestions on how to improve SEO and discoverability of the website online: https://vercel.com/blog/how-were-adapting-seo-for-llms-and-ai-search
  - first, generate me some proposals, i will decide myself which ones are worth implementing

consider also following features for the code structure:

- one should be able to specify a quote in place of a header image. how would you implement this? what would you do for OG image attributes in case of a quote?
- one should be able to specify a link to another website instead of a header image. it should use the target website og attributes to display a header image and a caption. Clicking on the imege brings one to that website. This should also only happen client side

Create a plan on how you would implement these tasks and in which order. You can group them together, such that they are easily reviewable in one pull request.
Make sure to consider all the future features in your planning, such that future pull requests can benefit in readability from the code structure.
Think hard to create a plan before you write a line of code, and then double check it.
Create a new plan based on these instructions, suggest an order of the features. Start ideally with easy features first, and maybe the ones that create the basis for the future features.
Write the plan in 001.md.
