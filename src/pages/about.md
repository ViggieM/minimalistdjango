This is a website primarily for personal use, where I document my learning journey in web development.
Despite the name _Minimalistdjango_, this site has little to do with the Django web framework.
However, Django is what sparked my interest in web development and opened up an incredibly broad path into this domain, allowing me to explore different approaches at my own pace.
There are countless amazing resources online about Django, and I have no intention of competing with those.

Web development is an expansive topic with endless learning opportunities.
I've discovered that learning by doing is consistently the most effective approach.

Additionally, there's a principle called 'Learning in Public', which adds another layer of depth when exploring a topic.
Trying to explain concepts to others essentially adds a fourth step to Confucius' quoteâ€”perhaps something like _I teach and I master_.

Moreover, writing sharpens my thinking, and in the age of LLMs, providing clear instructions yields better results.
I hope you'll find something useful in these articles. If you'd like to suggest improvements, feel free to [create an issue in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ViggieM/minimalistdjango).
The repository for this website is public.
