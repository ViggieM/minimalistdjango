This is a personal website where I document my learning journey in web development.
Despite the name _Minimalist Django_, this site has less to do with the Django web framework than with web development in general.
However, Django is what sparked my interest in web development and opened up an incredibly broad path into this domain, allowing me to explore different approaches at my own pace.

Web development is an expansive topic with endless learning opportunities.
I've discovered that learning by doing is consistently the most effective approach.

Additionally, there's a principle called 'Learning in Public', which adds another layer of depth when exploring a topic.
Trying to explain concepts to others essentially adds a fourth step to Confucius' quoteâ€”perhaps something like _I teach and I master_.

Moreover, writing sharpens my thinking, and in the age of LLMs, providing clear instructions yields better results.
I hope you'll find something useful in these articles.
