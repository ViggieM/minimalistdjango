There are a few things remaining to deploy our app to the VM.
We will cover those here and later we will automate everything with *Ansible*.
Besides, if you don't know how to do it *without* Ansible, then Ansible won't help you either.

## Transfor your code to the VM

To transfer your code on the VM, you have two options: *a)* you clone it locally and copy it over with scp, or *b)* you clone the Git repository directly inside the VM. Both of those are valid, feel free to choose what you like best.

### Copy with `scp`

*Scp* is a fundamental linux command that copies files between hosts on a network. The basic syntax for *scp* is:

```bash
scp -P <port> ./* <user>@<host>:/path/to/target/directory
```

This will copy everything from your current directory on the remote host (your VM).
**The downside is that your project's directory might include files that are only supposed to be for local usage**, like `.env` files, static files, build output, etc.
Therefore you might want to check out your repository into a separate directory and copy *its* content to the remote host.

### Clone from the VCS

To clone your code from a *version control system* (VCS) like *Github* you should have [*Git* installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on your local machine and on the remote host, [initialized a Git repository](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github) inside your project directory and pushed your code to the VCS.
If your GitHub repository is **public**, you can clone it without any problems on the VM.
In case your repository is **private**, you have two options:
1. You generate a **ssh private key** on your VM and [add it to the accepted SSH Keys in your GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
2. You generate an **access token** in your GitHub Account and clone the repository like this: `git clone https://MY_TOKEN@github.com/user-or-org/repo`
   The steps required to generate a new token are simple:
   * Go to [Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens){:target="_blank"}
   * Generate a personal access token (classic) with repo scope enabled.
     ![Select the checkbox 'repo' to create an access token with 'read' rights](/images/github-access-token.png){:style="margin-bottom: 10px; box-shadow: 3px 3px    7px -5px #000000; border-radius: 3px"}
   * Clone like this: `git clone https://MY_TOKEN@github.com/user-or-org/repo`

> **🧐 Some notes on *git clone***
> 
> `git clone` has several options, two of which I consider particularly useful:
> * you can specify the tag / branch you want to checkout with the option `--branch` (or `-b`)
> * you can reduce the amount of files that are cloned with `--depth 1`

## Set up the python environment

I assume you have already [installed *pyenv*][pyenv-install] inside your VM.
Now you can set up a virtual environment for your application with:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.3
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.3 my-app
pyenv activate my-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will create a new python environment inside `$PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.11.3/envs/my_app` with your application's requirements.
Now inside your app's directory `/srv/my_app/` create a `.env` file.
Here, you can specify the location of your virtual environment with

```init
VIRTUAL_ENV=$PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.10.6/envs/my_app-0.1.0
```

Be careful that the environment variable `$PYENV_ROOT` might not be defined when you start your application with *Systemd*,
so you should specify the absolute path to your virtual environment.

## Further reading

The rest is described in [this post]({% link _posts/2023-06-25-supervisor.md%}#systemd) how to set up a *Systemd* service that runs your application.
If you follow along, you will have your application running on port 80 inside your VM.
The next step is to automate the entire process with *Ansible*.
