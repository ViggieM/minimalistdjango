```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Install a specific python version for your project with

```
pyenv install 3.11.3
pyenv local 3.11.3
poetry env use python
```

# Why should you use pyenv?

Pyenv allows you to easily manage multiple Python versions on your system, which is particularly useful when working with different Django projects that require specific versions of Python. Together with Poetry you will have a powerful and flexible development environment for your Django projects, enabling you to manage Python versions and dependencies easily and efficiently.

# More installation instructions

You could add also following lines to your `.profile` as described in the [Documentation][pyenv-doc-shell]

```
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.profile
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.profile
```
