With **[fly.io](https://fly.io/)** it is extremely simple to deploy you app to production.
You only need a few commands after you created a new django project to deploy your app and make it publicly accessible to everyone on the internet.
```
fly auth signup
fly launch
fly deploy
```
Really, it's that simple!

# Deploy your new Django application with Fly

The following steps apply if you have started a new Django project as described in ["Manage python versions like a pro"]({% post_url 2023-05-04-pyenv %}) and ["Start a new Django project"]({% post_url 2023-05-04-startproject %}):

1. Install flctl ([official documentation](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/))
2. Sign up to fly with: `fly auth signup`
3. You will need to add gunicorn as a http server to your project dependencies.
    ```
    poetry add gunicorn
    ```
4. Adjust your `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting to match the host name of your application. 
  For convenience you can set it to `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]` for now, but for more security you should change it later to be more specific.
5. Execute `fly launch`: This will generate some additional files that will allow you to deploy your application with `fly deploy`. 
  It will also automatically generate a `SECRET_KEY` environment variable for you, so you don't need to take care of that.
6. Since your application is inside a `src` directory, you need to change following line inside the automatically generated Dockerfile: `COPY . /code` becomes `COPY src/ /code`.
7. Deploy your app with `fly deploy`!


# Considerations

* fly.io completely abstracts the way a django app is deployed
* Consider reading the [official documentation on how to deploy a Django app on fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/django/getting-started/) for any changes and further information on the deployment process
