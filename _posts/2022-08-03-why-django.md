## What is Django?

Django is a web framework written in Python. 
And Python is most likely the easiest programming language to learn.
So Django is probably the easiest way to learn web development.
Django is specifically a web framework.
Like other software frameworks, it dictates the structure of your project but it makes it easy to customize your appliction.
It has some built in performance optimisations, takes care of the most common security issues you don't even know exist.

## What can you do with Django?

With Django you can create dynamic websites, web applications or web services.

**Static vs dynamic websites:**
Static websites provide content for _people_ to read.
But in contrast to dynamic websites they do not allow users to interact with it, e.g. post a comment or create content.
Dynamic websites allow users to interact with it, e.g. a forum or an online shop.

**Web application vs website:**
Web applications are built for full interactivity between _people_ and application.
Users are normally required to log in and are presented with individualized content.
Spotify has for example a desktop application, a web application and a mobile application.

**Web service vs web application:**
A web service is not at all designed for a human to interact with it. 
The information on the web service is accessed by machines.
An example for a web service is a weather API.
It provides structured information that can be accessed by your application to display on your own site.

## Why not Django?

The only downside of Django is that **IT IS SLOW**.
Python is slow. 
There is nothing you can change about that, except not using Python.
But sometimes it is more important to build a new application and put it out there in the world to be useful, than making it super fast.
There are some techniques to make a Django website performant as well, most of which have nothing to do with Django and are applicable to any website.

## TL;DR

So the answer to the Question _"Why Django?"_ is:
If you want to learn about the fundamentals of web development, then pick Django, because it takes care of a lot of details, while you can learn the big picture.
