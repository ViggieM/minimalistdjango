People say SQLite is a database that is unsuitable for production use because of low performance, inability to handle
multiple concurrent writes, blah blah blah.
This might not be quite true.

This article is inspired by [a talk at _DjangoCon 2023_][1]  and [an episode of _The Changelog_][2].

## Video summary
* SQLite is already in production. You can already see how many applications use SQLite on your computer with this command:
    ```bash
    find / \( -name "*.db" -o -name "*.sqlite" -o -name "*.sqlite3" \) -type f -exec file {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep SQLite
    ```
* [11:20](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE?t=682) it is a serverless database, which means you don't need to configure an extra host, manage access by your application server, etc.
* [14:25](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE?t=866) No performance loss because of network latency
* [15:31](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE?t=931) No N + 1 Query problems
* [17:31](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE?t=1051) Concurrent writes are not a problem if you turn [Write-Ahead Logging](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) for your SQLite database. For this, you can execute `sqlite3 db.sqlite3 'PRAGMA journal_mode=wal;'` in your shell.
* [19:02](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE?t=1142) Speed up writes even more by reducing the [synchronous level](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous)
* [20:53](https://youtu.be/yTicYJDT1zE?t=1253) You can easily back up the SQLite database with [Litestream](https://litestream.io/)


## Set up Django to run with SQLite

When creating a new Django project, it comes with following default setting for `DATABASES`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```

You can also use [`dj-database-url`](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url/) to configure your `DATABASES` setting. In this case, the `DATABASE_URL` might look like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///path/to/your/database/file.sqlite3
```

Now, before you start your django project for the first time, which automatically creates a SQLite database for you, you should create it yourself first, by running: 

```bash
sqlite3 db.sqlite3 'PRAGMA journal_mode=wal; PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;'
```

The PRAGMA synchronous setting is a little bit more tricky, since it does not apply to the database, [but to the database connection](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36308801/sqlite3-pragma-synchronous-not-persistent).
Hence, you have to change this setting [for all connections opened by the Django app](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6843199/5540654):

```python
from django.db.backends.signals import connection_created

def activate_foreign_keys(sender, connection, **kwargs):
    if connection.vendor == 'sqlite':
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute('PRAGMA synchronous=1;')

connection_created.connect(activate_foreign_keys)
```
