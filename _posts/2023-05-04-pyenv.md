[Pyenv][pyenv-install] allows you to easily manage multiple Python versions on your system, which is particularly useful when working with different Django projects that require specific versions of Python. 
Together with [Poetry][poetry] you will have a powerful and flexible development environment for your Django projects, enabling you to manage Python versions and dependencies easily and efficiently.

1. You can easily install pyenv with curl:
```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

2. Install a specific python version for your project with
```
pyenv install 3.11.3
pyenv local 3.11.3
poetry env use python
```
