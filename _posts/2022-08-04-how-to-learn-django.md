## Welcome to the Django!

Learning programming seems so easy.
Many people think that it is easy to learn how to code.
Well they should read ["Why learning to code is so damn hard"][1].
Programming is not easy. 
And until you are faced with real world problems, your are just like a newborn.
You are dependent on the grown ups to get you food, tell you when to eat and when to sleep, clean you, etc.
But as soon as you are out there on your own, you are in the jungle and you will get lost very quickly.

## `startproject`

A beginner web developer is like a baby.
Some friendly people out there gave away lots of their time to put together a literally _idiot proof_ project, and describe the reasoning behind every line of code.
There is an abundance of [learning material][todo-learning-material] on the internet that teach you how to create a Django project and lead you step by step through the entire project.
It is amazing how often you will see `django-admin startproject` and `virtualenv venv` out there, even in the more advanced tutorials.
At some point, you will skip over these parts, because you already know what all of them do, your project structure is different, but you still have to google for every new feature you build.
Chances are, there was someone smarter than you, who built this feature, way better than you could (in a short time), so why bother?
(There is a reason for that, but that will not be part of this post)

## **Y**et **A**nother **D**jango **B**log

So why another blog on Django, if there are already that many out there already?
The reason is purely selfish.
It is a better way _for me_ to learn.
To understand why, you should read ["Learn In Public"][2] by Swyx, or listen to this [episode on Changelog][3] (which is by the way an **amazing podcast**).

In short: 
* it gives me a way to clarify my thoughts
* create reference documentation for future me
* share some of my knowledge (maybe at least one person in the world will be greatful for this)
* [get feedback][todo-feedback] and connect with people

## TL;DR

I know you might be busy, you have a lot of new features to build (or a lot of bugs to fix), but if you follow these posts, you might find something interesting that will help you on your learning path.
