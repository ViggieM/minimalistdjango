Django is a remarkable web framework that is written in Python, one of the most accessible programming languages to learn. 
As such, it is the perfect starting point for those who wish to delve into web development. 
One of Django's most impressive features is its specificity towards web development. 
As with other software frameworks, it provides a framework for organizing your project, but it also makes it effortless to tailor your application to your exact specifications. 
Moreover, Django comes with built-in performance optimizations, ensuring that your application runs smoothly, while also taking care of the most common security issues that you may not even be aware of.

## The Lanscape of the Web

With Django you can create dynamic websites, web applications or web services.

**Static vs dynamic websites:**
Static websites provide content for _people_ to read.
But in contrast to dynamic websites they do not allow users to interact with it, e.g. post a comment or create content.
Dynamic websites allow users to interact with it, e.g. a forum or an online shop.

**Web application vs website:**
Web applications are built for full interactivity between _people_ and application.
Users are normally required to log in and are presented with individualized content.
Spotify has for example a desktop application, a web application and a mobile application.

**Web service vs web application:**
A web service is not at all designed for a human to interact with it. 
The information on the web service is accessed by machines.
An example for a web service is a weather API.
It provides structured information that can be accessed by your application to display on your own site.

## Reasons not to use Django

While Django is a powerful and popular web framework, it may not be the best fit for every project or development team. Here are a few reasons why someone might choose not to use Django:

1. Steep Learning Curve: Although Python is considered an easy-to-learn language, Django has a steep learning curve due to its many features and functionalities. It can take time to become proficient with the framework.
2. Overkill for Small Projects: Django is a full-stack web framework, which means it has many features and functionalities that may not be necessary for smaller projects. For small-scale projects, simpler frameworks or libraries might be a better choice.
3. Monolithic Architecture: Django follows a monolithic architecture, which means that it may not be the best choice for projects that require a more modular or microservices-based approach.
4. Heavyweight: Django is a feature-rich framework that comes with a lot of built-in functionality, making it a heavyweight solution. For projects that require a leaner framework or are focused on performance, Django may not be the best choice.
5. Lack of Flexibility: While Django is flexible in many ways, it can be limiting in terms of design and architecture choices. For projects that require a high degree of customization or unique architecture, Django may not be the best choice.

Ultimately, the decision to use Django or any other web framework should be based on the specific needs and requirements of the project at hand.
