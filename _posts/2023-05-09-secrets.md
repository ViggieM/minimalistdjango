Make sure that you don't expose secrets publicly (like the `SECRET_KEY`, **database credentials**, **API Keys**, etc.), especially when pushing your code to a version control system like git.

1. After starting a new django project your should change the following settings:
  * [`SECRET_KEY`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-SECRET_KEY): it does not matter for development, but you want to keep it constant, so you don't have to log in again (e.g. to the admin) every time you restart the server
  * [`DEBUG`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#debug): during development it is useful for tracing exceptions, but it is a "no-go" in production, as it exposes code and environment details
  * [`ALLOWED_HOSTS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts): this is a list of the host/domain names your application can serve

2. Create a `.env` in your project root which you can use with a module like `python-dotenv`. You can load the contents of the `.env` file in your `settings.py` as follows:
    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from pathlib import Path
    
    BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
    load_dotenv(BASE_DIR / ".env")
    ```
    Make sure `BASE_DIR / ".env"` matches the location of your `.env` file.

3. Add the `.env` file to `.gitignore`. 

# Examples

Example .env for development:
```
SECRET_KEY="django-insecure-g5teumg_e5pxvco27-18zu8rwg!frx&b8r7khpoj1luxq+j4k^"
DEBUG=1
```

Example .env for production:
```
SECRET_KEY="0_ttm+s!!+z_@fcg^%656-*5_g@p6t&i8&^l32$!k1fklqa=i8"
ALLOWED_HOSTS="minimalistdjango.com"
```

# Other environment variables you can configure

* `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: in your `manage.py` it uses this environment variable to define a project's settings file. This way you can specify different settings for different environments (e.g. development, staging, production)
* [`ROOT_URLCONF`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-ROOT_URLCONF): you can expose different routes of your app on different hosts to increase security
